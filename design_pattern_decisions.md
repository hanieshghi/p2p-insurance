I have used these design patterns:

1. circuit Breaker

2. Withdrawal Pattern:
'It protects against re-entrancy and denial of service attacks'

3. restrict access :
some of functions like stopContract and StartContract must be called by admin and not others. and other functions is also must called by registered addersses.
